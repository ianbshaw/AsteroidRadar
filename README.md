# Project Title

Asteroid Radar

## Getting Started

Asteroid Radar is an app to view the asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth, you can view all the detected asteroids in a period of time, their data (Size, velocity, distance to Earth) and if they are potentially hazardous.

The app is consists of two screens: A Main screen with a list of all the detected asteroids and a Details screen that is going to display the data of that asteroid once it´s selected in the Main screen list. The main screen will also show the NASA image of the day to make the app more striking.

## Project Instructions

You will be provided with a starter code, which includes the necessary dependencies and plugins that you have been using along the courses and that you are going to need to complete this project. 

The most important dependencies we are using are:
- Retrofit to download the data from the Internet.
- Moshi to convert the JSON data we are downloading to usable data in form of custom classes.
- Glide to download and cache images.
- RecyclerView to display the asteroids in a list.

## Built With

This project uses the NASA NeoWS (Near Earth Object Web Service) API, which you can find here.
https://api.nasa.gov/

You will need an API Key which is provided for you in that same link, just fill the fields in the form and click Signup.
